This repository contains scripts and supplemental data from "Fine-mapping, trans-ancestral and genomic analyses identify causal variants, cells, genes and drug targets for type 1 diabetes" ([Robertson, Inshaw, et al 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.19.158071v1))

Please see the scripts directory for a detailed description of the analysis pipeline and subdirectories for code used to implement analyses.

Results from fine-mapping T1D-associated ImmunoChip regions using the software [GUESSFM](https://github.com/chr1swallace/GUESSFM) are in the supplemental data directory. For easy access to the image files, we recommend cloning the repository to your local computer, which will allow you to open any image (.png) files with your preferred desktop image viewer.
You can do so by running the following command in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/ccrobertson/t1d-immunochip-2020
```
