This repository contains scripts and supplemental data from "Fine-mapping, trans-ancestral and genomic analyses identify causal variants, cells, genes and drug targets for type 1 diabetes"

Please see the scripts directory for a detailed description of the analysis pipeline and subdirectories for code used to implement analyses.

Results from fine-mapping T1D-associated ImmunoChip regions using the software [GUESSFM](https://github.com/chr1swallace/GUESSFM) are in the supplemental data directory.
