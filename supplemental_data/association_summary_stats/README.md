* __alleleB__ is the effect allele, meaning the "Effect_EUR" and "Effect_phaseIandII" columns are the betas (i.e. log odds ratios) for each additional copy of the B allele
* __Effect_EUR__ is the log odds ratio for each additional copy of alleleB among unrelated European cases (N=13,458) and controls (N=20,143)
* __SE_EUR__ is the standard error for effect described in Effect_EUR
* __AF_EUR__ = frequency of alleleB in unrelated European cases (N=13,458) and controls (N=20,143)
* EffectphaseIandII = log odds ratio for each additional copy of alleleB in meta-analysis of the full cohort (
* SEphaseIandII = standard error for effect described in Effect_phaseIandII
* pphaseIandII = pvalue for EffectphaseIandII
