Results from subsampling 80% of the EUR case-control cohort five times and running the GUESSFM fine-mapping procedure on each of the five subsampled data sets. These results help to determine the robustness of the results presented in Figure 1b-d to sampling noise. 

Figures within each subsampling directory are the same as in the primary fine-mapping directories. Please see the "Details about subdirectory content" section at https://github.com/ccrobertson/t1d-immunochip-2020/tree/master/supplemental_data
